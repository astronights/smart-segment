# Optimization-Based Customer Segmentation

This repository provides an optimization-based segmentation tool for business intelligence, enabling data-driven segmentation of customers for targeted marketing efforts. The algorithm uses customer propensities (predicted probabilities of an event) and historical data (actual outcomes) to optimize the segmentation process, maximizing expected revenue while accounting for costs and penalties. This dynamic approach leads to more effective and fine-tuned segments compared to naive or percentile-based methods.

## Key Features
- **Optimized Segmentation**: The algorithm dynamically adjusts segmentation boundaries to maximize expected revenue, based on conversion rates and customer acquisition costs.
- **Customizable Functions**: Users can define their own revenue and cost functions depending on business needs.
- **Adaptable to Different Data**: The tool adapts to the actual distribution of customer propensities and conversion behaviors, ensuring resource allocation to the most promising segments.
- **Merge Small Bins**: Automatically merges bins that don't meet a minimum sample size, leading to more robust segmentation.
  
This segmentation tool is particularly useful for business intelligence teams seeking to enhance the return on investment (ROI) for marketing campaigns by focusing on high-value segments.

## Advantages of Optimization Algorithm Segmentation

### 1. **Higher Conversion Rates in Key Segments**
   - The algorithm identifies high-potential segments with significantly higher conversion rates. It balances conversion rates effectively across segments, unlike naive or percentile methods that might overlook smaller but valuable segments.

### 2. **Fine-Grained Segmentation**
   - Provides finely tuned segments based on customer behavior, enabling more precise and dynamic targeting. This allows for personalized marketing strategies that can adapt to changing customer behavior.

### 3. **Dynamic Response to Customer Behavior**
   - The algorithm adapts to the actual distribution of customer propensities and conversion behaviors. It adjusts in real-time, unlike fixed-interval methods which may misrepresent certain customer groups.

### 4. **Mitigation of Underperformance in Small Bins**
   - Bins with insufficient samples are automatically merged, ensuring that small bins donâ€™t distort insights or lead to poor resource allocation in marketing campaigns.

### 5. **Holistic Revenue Consideration**
   - The algorithm factors in both conversion rates and acquisition costs, aiming to maximize net revenue rather than focusing solely on conversion rates.

### 6. **Strategic Focus on High-Value Segments**
   - By optimizing segmentation based on expected revenue, businesses can prioritize high-value customer segments, leading to improved marketing ROI and a strategic focus on growth areas.

## Installation

You can install the package from the PyPI repository
    
```bash
pip install smart-segment
```

## Usage

This example shows how to use the `find_optimal_bins` function to find the optimal segmentation for a marketing campaign:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from smart_segment.segmentation import find_optimal_bins

# Example data (Simulating imbalanced data with a Gamma distribution)
dists = np.random.gamma(2, 2, 100_000)
data = {'propensity': np.sort(np.clip(dists, 0, 20)/20.0),
        'y': np.random.choice([0, 1], 100_000)}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Constant revenue, with varying cost (depending on propensity)
revenue_fn = lambda ix: 30
cost_fn = lambda ix: 2 * ix

# Find optimal bins with custom revenue and cost functions
result = find_optimal_bins(df['propensity'], df['y'], n_bins=10, 
                        revenue_fn=revenue_fn,
                        cost_fn=cost_fn, penalty_factor=0,
                        min_samples=10, global_search=True)
best_n_bins, best_cutoffs, max_revenue = result

# Apply the segmentation to the DataFrame
df['optim_global'] = pd.cut(df['propensity'], best_cutoffs, include_lowest=False, duplicates='drop')

print(f"Best number of bins: {best_n_bins}")
print(f"Best cutoffs: {best_cutoffs}")
print(f"Maximum Revenue: {max_revenue}")
```

The first two parameters are:
- `propensities`: Machine Learning / AI model output probabilities
- `predictions`: Binary outcome on customer activity (or) purchase

The configurable parameters are as follows:

- `n_bins`: Number of bins to split into
- `revenue_fn`: Revenue per customer, function of bin id (starting from 0), usually constant.
- `cost_fn`: Cost per customer, function of bin id (starting from 0), usally incremental over channels
- `penalty_factor`: Penalty factor for exploration, `> 0` value if your search is stuck in a local minimum
- `min_samples`: Minimum number of samples in a group
- `global_search`: Whether to use the differential evolution or the quantile based algorithm

**NOTE**: All examples here use `global_search=True` as the quantile-based method (`global_search=False`) is identical to the Percentile split. 

## Performance

Tests were conducted to compare the performance of various customer segmentation strategies using the generated propensity groups. 

The peformances of this optimized method are compared with the conventional methods used:

- **Uniform**: Implemented with `pd.cut`
- **Percentile**: Implemented with `pd.qcut`

The table below presents key metrics for each segmentation strategy. Each cell contains the following information:
- **Metric**: Value of the metric
- **Band**: Range of propensity scores associated with that group formatted as (lower - upper)
- **Customer Conversion**: Number of customers that converted out of the total customers in the group, formatted as [converted/total]

The optimized model significantly outperforms both the uniform and percentile segmentation strategies across all metrics. It exhibits the highest lowest conversion rate, showing that even the least effective groups are yielding a better performance than their counterparts in the other strategies. Additionally, the optimized model leads to a substantial increase in total revenue and revenue per customer, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying high-value customer segments. This results in a more efficient targeting strategy, ultimately enhancing overall business revenue.

Granular statistics across bands for each of the strategies can be found in the `examples` directory.

### Conversion Plots

Here are plots showing the distribution of conversion rates and the revenue / customer across the various methods.

The conversion rates are represented through the following visualizations:
- **Bar Chart**: Displays the number of customers in each segment.
- **Line Chart**: Shows the corresponding number of conversions for each segment.
- **Color Scale**: Illustrates the conversion rate across the different bands.

Additionally, the **Revenue per Customer** is indicated above each bar in the bar chart, providing a clear view of the economic impact of each segment.
